A simple Chess Bot using Rust

To clone the repository run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shashankp28/mystic-bot.git
```

## Bot Algorithm

### Bit-Board Representation

```rust
#[derive( Copy, Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize )]
pub struct Board {

    // Flattended Matrix representation of 8x8 Chess Board, with `a1` at the Top-Left
    // Bit is 1 if the corresponding piece is at corresponding index else 0
    // The black and white parts of the boards are concatenated in 64+64 = 128 bits
    // The MSB part corresponds to black and LSB part corresponds to white
    // The below representation based on
    // Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4FFX_otR-4&pp=ygUSbWFraW5nIGEgY2hlc3MgYm90
    pub rooks: u128,
    pub knights: u128,
    pub bishops: u128,
    pub queens: u128,
    pub kings: u128,
    pub pawns: u128,

    // 1 bit, whether the board has an en-passant
    // It is not possible for a board to have multiple en-passants at the same time!
    // ( [ X bits full move number ], [ 7 bits Half move clock ], is_white_move, en_passant_warn,
    //   [ 3 bits en_passant_column  ], Black o-o, Black o-o-o, White o-o, White o-o-o )
    //   --> 16 + fullmove_number / 32 bits used
    pub metadata: u32,
}
```

## Display Chess Board

This project allows you to generate a chessboard image with pieces displayed on it. The pieces and the board are represented as images stored in a specified directory. You can customize the arrangement of the pieces by modifying the board configuration.

### Features

- Customizable chessboard layout.
- Generates a PNG image of the chessboard with pieces.
- Uses the Pillow library for image processing.

### Requirements

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Using the `analysis.ipynb` is straight-forward

## Overview

[lichess-bot](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot) is a free bridge
between the [Lichess Bot API](https://lichess.org/api#tag/Bot) and chess engines.

With lichess-bot, you can create and operate a bot on lichess. Your bot will be able to play against humans and bots alike, and you will be able to view these games live on lichess.

See also the lichess-bot [documentation](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot/wiki) for further usage help.

## Features
Supports:
- Every variant and time control
- UCI, XBoard, and Homemade engines
- Matchmaking (challenging other bots)
- Offering Draws and Resigning
- Accepting move takeback requests from opponents
- Saving games as PGN
- Local & Online Opening Books
- Local & Online Endgame Tablebases

Can run on:
- Python 3.9 and later
- Windows, Linux and MacOS
- Docker
